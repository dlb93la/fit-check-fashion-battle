The audit did not alter tracked project files.

## Mobile validation

The project owner separately completed a **physical Android playtest** of the submission build.

Browser viewport/emulation evidence is not presented as a substitute for physical-device testing.

No physical iOS validation is claimed.

## Social / gameplay scope

- six contestant slots
- bots fill missing contestant positions
- three 1v1 runway duels
- eligible non-duelists can vote
- active duelists cannot vote in their own duel
- duplicate/stale/invalid ballots are rejected by game rules
- late arrivals can watch and vote when eligible
- the next round starts automatically

## Session-only boundaries

The following are prototype/session systems and are **not** claimed as permanent cross-visit progression:

- Style Point balance
- purchases
- rankings
- Hall/champion history
- saved look

There is no trusted authoritative game server and no on-chain game economy.

## Current documentation hierarchy

For final submission facts, use these references in this order:

1. `README.md`
2. `design/gdd.md`
3. `docs/FINAL-SUBMISSION-STATUS.md`

Older `design/implementation-status.md` and `design/delivery-validation.md` remain historical audit/evidence documents and may contain statements that were correct at earlier checkpoints but were superseded by the final submission state.
